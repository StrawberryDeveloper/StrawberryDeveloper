Hi, I'm Gabriel, a **mechatronics student** based in Austria with a strong interest in **software engineering** and **game development**.
 
I'm currently developing [**Automatica**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3312180/Automatica/), a 2D automation game built in Unity with C#. Alongside my projects, I explore web technologies and share insights about game development and programming on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@StrawberryDeveloper).

### Skills & Tools

- Unity (C#) – game development
- JetBrains Rider / Visual Studio – coding
- Git & GitHub – version control
- Web Development – Blazor, HUGO, React

### My Motivation

I created this blog to document my experiences and share insights about:

- Game development and software engineering
- Behind-the-scenes of my YouTube projects
- Math and science

> Coding is the closest thing we have to magic in the real world.
